# e-commerce-BE

## Purpose

    The purpose of this homework is to create a backend for a supposed ecommerce company and to learn how we can create our routes and how to connect our models with each other using belongToMany, belongsTo, hasMany and etc. It was pretty challenging as it is not something i am completely comfortable with, however, it did feel like an accomplishment seeing it work in the insomnia app.

## Inspiration

    Aside from it being homework. The inspiration came from learning something new outside of what is comfortable, and trying to get a better understanding for the backend.
